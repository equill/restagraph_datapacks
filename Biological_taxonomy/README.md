Biological taxonomy
===================

Sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)), it's a basic implementation of [taxonomic ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank).

Only the 8 basic ranks are currently covered:

- Dominions
- Kingdoms
- Phyla (phylum)
- Classes
- Orders
- Families
- Genera (genus)
- Species

The additional zoological and botanical ranks have been left out for now, as this is only the first pass.

All resourcetypes are named in the plural, per the convention within Restagraph, and all have the prefix "Taxonomic."

The prefix is necessary to avoid confusion with terms of the same name that have different meanings in other context, i.e. kingdom, class and order. It's applied to all of them to avoid confusion, per the principle of least astonishment.
