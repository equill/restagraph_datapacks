Restagraph datapacks
====================

This is a collection of subschemas for Restagraph to cover specific subject domains, such as biological taxonomy or audio sample categories.

At some future point, it may also include a means of installing data to go along wih those schemas. So once you've installed the taxonomy schema, there will (hopefully) be some sensible way of also adding the dominions, kingdoms, phyla and so on, at least to the extent that there aren't still any raging arguments about where a thing fits in that hierarchy.
